# urbanConnect
Reproducible workflow in R for measuring **ecological connectivity** in urban areas. 

Here you will find a collection of R scripts, functions and tutorials for calculating an ecological connectivity index based on "effective mesh size", a geometric measure of connectivity developed by [Jochen Jaeger (2000)](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1008129329289), see also [Spanowicz & Jaeger 2019](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-019-00881-0). This method has also been used by [(Deslauriers et al. 2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X17300912) in the development of the City Biodiversity Inex #2.
